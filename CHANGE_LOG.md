# 2025-12-06 — Governance scaffold + roadmap draft
- Added `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, adapted from the FHOPS templates, to codify the coding-agent contract, doc/test expectations, and GPU/HPC data-handling rules for the new project.
- Created `CHANGE_LOG.md` (this file) and `notes/roadmap.md` so future work items, status, and command cadences stay traceable from the outset.
- Commands executed:
  - `cat > AGENTS.md`
  - `cat > CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `cat > CHANGE_LOG.md`
  - `cat > notes/roadmap.md`
